    "Another fundamental data structure is the queue. It is a close “cousin” of the stack, as a queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. That is, elements can be inserted at any time, but only the element that has been in the queue the longest can be next removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two fundamental methods for a queue Q:\n",
    "* Q.enqueue(e): add element e to the back of queue Q. \n",
    "* Q.dequeue(): remove and return the first element of from queue Q. an error may occur if the queue is emtpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three supporting methods:\n",
    "* Q.first(): return a reference to the element at the front of the queue without removing it. An error occurs if the queue is empty.\n",
    "* Q.is_empty(): return True is queue Q does not contain any elements.\n",
    "* len(Q): implement with the special method. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the stack ADT, we created a very simple adapter class that used a Python list as the underlying storage. It may be very tempting to use a similar approach for supporting the queue ADT. We could enqueue element e by calling append(e) to add it to the end of the list. We could use the syntax pop(0), as opposed to pop(), to intentionally remove the first element from the list when dequeuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As easy as this would be to implement, it is tragically inefficient. As we dis- cussed in Section 5.4.1, when pop is called on a list with a non-default index, a loop is executed to shift all elements beyond the specified index to the left, so as to fill the hole in the sequence caused by the pop. Therefore, a call to pop(0) always causes the worst-case behavior of Θ(n) time.\n",

    "In developing a more robust queue implementation, we allow the front of the queue to drift rightward, and we allow the contents of the queue to “wrap around” the end of an underlying array. We assume that our underlying array has fixed length N that is greater that the actual number of elements in the queue. New elements are enqueued toward the “end” of the current queue, progressing from the front to index N − 1 and continuing at index 0, then 1.\n",

    "to the quotient 4, while 14 % 3 evaluates to the remainder 2. The modulo operator is ideal for treating an array circularly. As a concrete example, if we have a list of length 10, and a front index 7, we can advance the front by formally computing (7+1) % 10, which is simply 8, as 8 divided by 10 is 0 with a remainder of 8. Similarly, advancing index 8 results in index 9. But when we advance from index 9 (the last one in the array), we compute (9+1) % 10, which evaluates to index 0 (as 10 divided by 10 has a remainder of zero)."

For example, we described a restaurant using a queue to maintain a waitlist. Occassionally, the first person might be removed from the queue only to find that a table was not available; typically, the restaurant will re-insert the person at the first position in the queue. It may also be that a customer at the end of the queue may grow impatient and leave the restaurant. (We will need an even more general data structure if we want to model customers leaving the queue from other positions.)\n",
