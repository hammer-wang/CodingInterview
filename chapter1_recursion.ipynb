    "# Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a technique by which a function makes one or more calls to itself during execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of the very same type of structure in its representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for per- forming repetitive tasks. In fact, a few programming languages (e.g., Scheme, Smalltalk) do not explicitly support looping constructs and instead rely directly on recursion to express repetition. Most modern programming languages support functional recursion using the identical mechanism that is used to support tradi- tional forms of function calls. __When one invocation of the function make a recur- sive call, that invocation is suspended until the recursive call completes.__\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursion trace closely mirrors the programming language’s execution of the recursion. In Python, each time a function (recursive or otherwise) is called, a structure known as an __activation record__ or __frame__ is created to store information about the progress of that invocation of the function. This activation record includes a namespace for storing the function call’s parameters and local variables (see Section 1.10 for a discussion of namespaces), and information about which command in the body of the function is currently executing.\n",
