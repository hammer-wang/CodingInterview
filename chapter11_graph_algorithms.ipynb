    "Viewed abstractly, a graph G is simply a set V of vertices and a collection E of pairs of vertices from V , called edges. Thus, a graph is a way of representing connections or relationships between pairs of objects from some set V . Incidentally, some books use different terminology for graphs and refer to what we call vertices as nodes and what we call edges as arcs. We use the terms “vertices” and “edges.”\n",

    "The definition of a graph refers to the group of edges as a collection, not a set, thus allowing two undirected edges to have the same end vertices, and for two directed edges to have the same origin and the same destination. Such edges are called parallel edges or multiple edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "With few exceptions, graphs do not have parallel edges or self-loops. Such graphs are said to be simple. Thus, we can usually say that the edges of a simple graph are a set of vertex pairs (and not just a collection). Throughout this chapter, we assume that a graph is simple unless otherwise specified.\n",

    "Given vertices u and v of a (directed) graph G, we say that u reaches v, and that v is reachable from u, if G has a (directed) path from u to v. In an undirected graph, the notion of reachability is symmetric, that is to say, u reaches v if an only if v reaches u. However, in a directed graph, it is possible that u reaches v but v does not reach u, because a directed path must be traversed according to the respective directions of the edges. A graph is connected if, for any two vertices, there is a path between them. A directed graph Gì is strongly connected if for any two vertices u and v of Gì , u reaches v and v reaches u.\n",

    "A subgraph of a graph G is a graph H whose vertices and edges are subsets of the vertices and edges of G, respectively. A spanning subgraph of G is a subgraph of G that contains all the vertices of the graph G. If a graph G is not connected, its maximal connected subgraphs are called the connected components of G. A forest is a graph without cycles. A tree is a connected forest, that is, a connected graph without cycles. A spanning tree of a graph is a spanning subgraph that is a tree."
