# Introduction:
This is a study plan I complied when I was preparing for the coding interviews of Google and Facebook for interns. I only had less than 2 weeks to prepare for the Google interview, and 1 month to prepare for the Facebook interview. As an undergraduate, I studied optoelectronics. Though I took Introduction to Computer Science and C++ Programming in my freshman year,  I’ve never taken a rigorous data structure and algorithms before. So, this plan is friendly to beginner to intermediate level interviewees who want to crack the coding interview in a short amount of time. Please feel free to use this study plan to boost your own preparation for Python coding interview. If you find this plan helpful, please star this repo.

Disclaimer: I’m a machine learning PhD, and I code everyday for my research projects. So, this plan may not be suitable for complete beginners.

## II. Estimated Time to Prepare (Sep 29th):
	Min/Max hrs before Google ([Oct 7th, Oct 11th] : 71hrs/99hr
	Hrs before Facebook (Oct 28th): ~160 hrs

## III. High-level Strategies:
- Schedule time to study and practice.
- Prioritize breadth over depth.
- Set aside time to review what you’ve practiced.
- Remember your goal: aim for confidently solving two questions while thinking aloud in 35 minutes.
- Practice coding the way you’ll code during your tech screen.
- Practice coding solutions to medium and hard problems in less than 15 mins each.
- Provide the most efficient solution and find and fix the bugs.
- Practice talking through the problem space and possible solutions before you dive in, talk through the decisions out loud as you code.

## IV. Steps of interview:
- Ask questions to classify the question
- Think out loud
- Speaking about time and space complexity
- Optimize the solution
- Test cases

## V. Everyday plan
I’m a PhD student in Machine Learning and I generally have to spend >60 hrs working on my research projects every week. I have to prepare for the Google interview within 10 days so I have to allocate a large chunk of time everyday before the interview. I made this plan considering the load of my research tasks. You can modify the plan based on your daily work and how far away is your interview.

### Starting date: Sep 28h
### Before Google interview (any day between Oct 7th - Oct 11th)
- Sleep 5-6 hrs everyday, make sure I have at least 16 hrs working and preparing
- Devote at least 7 hrs every day preparing (6:30-9am, 8pm-12:30am) on weekdays
- Devote at least 12 hrs preparing on weekends

### After Google interview, before Facebook interview (Oct 28th):
- Devote at least 3.5 hrs everyday preparing on weekdays (6:30-7:30am, 10pm-12:30am)
- Devote at least 6 hrs preparing on weekends (6:30-10:00 am, 10pm -12:30am)

- string
- Bit manipulation
- Two pointers
- Linked list
- Stacks and Queues
- Backtracking
- Hashing
- Heaps and Maps
- Tree
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy algorithm
- Graph data structure and algorithms
- Sorting: quicksort and merge sort (merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, heapsort, - insertion-sort, radix-sort)
- Most famous classes of NP-complete problems: traveling salesman and knapsack problem. What does NP-complete mean?
- Trees, basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms, hash tables, stacks, arrays, linked lists, priority queues
- Hash tables are the most important data structure known to mankind. (should be able to implement one with only arrays) Know the O()characteristics of the standard library implementation for hashtables and maps in the chosen language.
- Trees: tree construction, traversal, manipulation, binary trees. N-ary trees, trie-trees. Balanced binary tree, red/black tree, splay tree or an AVL tree. Know how to implement them. BFS and DFS. Know the difference between inorder, postorder, and preorder.
- Min/Max heaps. Understand the application and O() characteristics. Probably won’t implement, but it’s important to know when it makes sense to use one.
- Graphs: three representations. Objects and pointers, matrix, adjacency list. Basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first and depth-first search. Know the computational complexity, tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code.
- Recursion.
- Divide and conquer
- hashset/hashmap/hashtable/dictionary
- Operating systems: You should understand processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they all work. Understand deadlock, livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a process needs and a thread needs. Understand how context switching works, how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.
- Math: Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because counting problems, probability problems and other Discrete Math 101 situations surrounds us. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk – the more the better.
- Distributed systems and parallel programming
- How search works
- Scalable web architecture and distributed system

- Interview tips: 1) ask can I think for a second? 2) think out loud to show your thought process; 3) use examples; 4) Does this seem like a good strategy?
- Watch binary search tree, bit representation, bit manipulation
- sorting: bubble sort O(n^2), O(1)

### 2019-10-02
- Heap
- Tries
- Graph
- Backtracking: after we realize we made a wrong decision, we just go back to a place with another path. It's mostly associated with recursion.
- My recursion is pretty weak, I should do more about it.
- Watch videos on recursion and do more problems about it.

Cycle:
- recursion [Y]
- DFS [Y]
- BFS [Y]
- dynamic programming [Y]
- stack, queue, or hash table [Y]
- graph []
- backtracking []
- heaps []
- two pointers [Y]

- Finished two mock interviews [Y], it looks like that most of the problems are about strings and arrays for the mock interview.

 I should do more recursion problems.
